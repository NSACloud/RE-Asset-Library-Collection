# NO GAME ASSETS ARE INCLUDED
**These asset libraries do not contain any game assets. You must own the games and extract the game files yourself.**

The way asset libraries with this addon works is very simple.

Asset libraries downloaded by this addon only contain the following things:
* The path to where a file can be found.
* The names, categories and tags associated with that file.
* A rendered preview image of said file.
* Additional metadata required for importing the library to Blender.

When an asset is dragged from the asset browser, the addon will search through the extracted game files on the user's system.

If the file is present on the system, it will be imported by an addon associated with that file.
